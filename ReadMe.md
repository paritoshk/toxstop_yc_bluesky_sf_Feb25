# ToxStop Bot
ToxStop is an innovative bot designed for the BlueSky platform, aimed at identifying and mitigating toxic conversations in real-time. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, ToxStop provides a safer, more respectful online environment. When a user prompts ToxStop with @toxstop help or @toxstop stop tox, the bot activates its dual-function mechanism: first, detecting potential toxicity in the conversation, and then, generating a diffuser comment designed to de-escalate the situation.

## Features
- Toxicity Detection: Utilizes a pretrained model to accurately identify toxic content in conversations.
- Diffuser Comment Generation: Employs a language model (LLM) like GPT to create responses that aim to de-escalate tensions.
- Easy Activation: Users can summon ToxStop with simple commands, making it accessible to everyone in the conversation.
# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
BlueSky account and API access
Python 3.8 or later
Access to a pretrained toxicity classifier
Access to a language model capable of generating text (e.g., GPT)

## Installation
Clone the ToxStop repository:
```
git clone 
cd toxstop
```
Install required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Configure your .env file with necessary API keys and model paths.
Usage
Deploy ToxStop to a server with BlueSky API access.
Ensure ToxStop is registered and active on your BlueSky account.
To use ToxStop, simply type @toxstop help or @toxstop stop tox in any conversation.
